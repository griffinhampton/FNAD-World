# FNAD World (CSV Reader Project)

## Overview

This project was created for a **CSE 120 final project**, but ended up being an immense undertaking. I had to learn advanced skills in **file reading with big data**, without the help of SQL. The main skill I used was the **enumeration of each object in multi-row/column files**.

## Key Skills & Applications

The skill of object enumeration in structured text files is applicable in many **computer science** and **data analytics** fields. Through this project, I developed a strong understanding of how to manage big data manually, which can be adapted for various use cases:

- Managing **spritemaps** in game development (as used in this project)
- Finding **user information** based on keywords
- Parsing and analyzing **error logs**
- Locating **specific items in large lists**
- General **pattern recognition** in structured datasets

This project highlights the foundational power of simple data parsing tools, even in the absence of traditional database systems.
